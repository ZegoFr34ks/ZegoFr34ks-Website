          <p class="text">A game I made using Unreal Engine (Blueprint). Took me a bit less than a month. This is just a experimental project in which I test out stuff. In this project the player is in First Person and can shoot (=FPS). You have 3 weapons in total that who can change at anytime either by using number keys or the scroll wheel. At first you have an automatic rifle which shoots in rapid-fire mode when holding the left mouse button; the second one is a pistol which shoots only one bullet but does more damage per shot, it also has a reload animation. it has ennemies that shoot you and that you can kill. A lot of visual effects are implemented like an explosion when killing an ennemy, shoot animation + VFX and post processing and camera shakes. A lot of coding is dedicated to movement mechanics, like sprinting/walking/crouching/slinding, when sliding or sprinting the FOV increases and you can wallrun too! There are jumping platforms that will launch you up. A timer, and a grapple hook that lets the player swing through the map (it's not very good yet though and a bit buggy) but except the grapple mechanic every thing is working just fine, and it is very fun to play because the main focus was to make the smooth with smooth movement like the game Apex Legends but even more focused on movement. The code is pretty complex and there is a lot of math because of speed and position calculations, most being vectorial calculations. It's very fun to make but very complex for my level of coding, so I sometimes get stuck on simple problems for a long time.</p>
